# AI for Social Impact: Fast Fashion Analysis

## Research Context
Fast fashion has significant environmental and social impacts. This project investigates how data-driven methods and machine learning can be used to analyze and evaluate ethical practices in the fashion industry.

## Research Objectives
- Analyze the relationship between production cost, pricing, and labor conditions.
- Identify patterns associated with unethical practices.
- Explore whether machine learning models can predict ethical risk.

## Research Questions
- Can data features predict unethical manufacturing practices?
- Which variables have the strongest influence on ethical outcomes?
- How reliable are data-driven indicators in this context?

## Dataset
- Web-scraped data from e-commerce platforms (e.g., Vertbaudet)
- Public socio-economic indicators (World Bank)
- Product pricing and sourcing information

## Methodology
- Data scraping and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Decision Tree modeling
- Visualization dashboards

## Experiments
- Feature importance analysis
- Classification of ethical risk
- Cross-validation evaluation

## Key Findings
- Strong correlation between low production cost and ethical risk
- Pricing alone is insufficient to assess ethical practices
- Data-driven indicators can support ethical auditing

## Limitations
- Limited access to certified ethical datasets
- Possible bias in scraped data
- Small sample size

## Future Work
- Integration of certified NGO datasets
- Advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Longitudinal analysis
- Causal inference approaches
